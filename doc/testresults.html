<p>The UI was tested by three subjects that answered 14 questions using a
Likert scale of 5 points, where 1 is "bad" and 5 is "good". </p>

<p>The results are in the table below. </p>

<p>The average of all averages is 3.52, somehow positive as it is over the
theoretical average of 2.52. </p>

<p>The performance of the test was affected by some issues of the testing
instructions and defects of the UI proper. </p>

<p>The plan for the future is to consider this test series a pilot, fix the
issues, and roll out a new series of many tests with varies subjects (as this
UI is intended to be used by anybody). </p>

<h4>findings</h4>

<p>Most of the findings came from the observation of the subjects. </p>
<ul>
  <li>[1] The meaning of the icons is not as obvious for non-geeks. </li>
  <li>[2] In particular, the less obvious item with the icons was that they
    have to be clicked once again in order to revert their effect. </li>
  <li>[3] One issue with the test design is that the subjects need to read too
    much and remember a number of steps. The instructions are lengthy. </li>
  <li>[4] The "control panel" (the vertical bar at the left of the window) is
    intrusive. </li>
  <li>[5] It was not clear that the hihglighting works by selecting the text
    first and then clicking the button. A user was used to do it the other way:
    selecting a highlight tool and then applying it to the text. </li>
  <li>[6] The transparency of the sliding panels make them difficult to read, 
    the users read slowly and have issues to scan for a word like "Microsoft"
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>changes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>[1]: Make new icons, crafted by a read graphics designer. </li>
  <li>[2]: At the first click of a button that slides a panel, change the state
    of the UI in order for the buttons to show that clicking again will
    "un-slide" that panel. Maybe with an arrow (a triangle as in the slide show
    controls) to indicate forward or back movement of the panel. </li>
  <li>[3]: Rewrite the consent form and the instructions to make them brief,
    about 50% of their current size. </li>
  <li>[3]: Make clear that the instructions are available all along the test by
    clicking the menu button (that according to [1] is not easily identifiable)
    possibly by showing a callout when the test page is opened. </li>
  <li>[3]: Make a screencast showing the basic operations, to save the subject
    from reading an abstract explanation. </li>
  <li>[4]: Make the control panel slowly faint until it's almost invisible, all
    but the progress indicator. Reshow it when used, or on hover for desktops.
  </li>
  <li>[4]: Make the control panel narrower. </li>
  <li>[4]: Make the control panel (almost) the same color as the text
    background. </li>
  <li>[4]: For mobile devices set the control panel as a horizontal bar
    (instead of vertical) at the bottom of the screen when in portrait mode.
  </li>
  <li>[5]: Make the highlighting work the other way too: clicking first in the
    highlight button turns it into a highlight tool that highlights the text as
    it is selected. Need to decide how unload the cursor. </li>
  <li>[6]: Make the sliding panels 100% opaque. </li>
</ul>

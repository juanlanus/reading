<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Some people prefer reading on paper tarher than on screen, and some prefer
the screen. Those are personal preferences and this article does not intend to
question them. This article tries to be an unbiased enumeration of the
advantages and disadvantages of each world. </p>

<p>If you notice that a feature is listed in both sides, or in one side both as
an advantage and as a disadvantage, it is not an error. In some cases it is so.
</p>

<p>Also, there is some overlapping between the advantages of one side and the
disadvantages of the other. I enumerate both because one side's advantage does
not necessarily grant other side's disadvantage. </p>

<p>Some items of the enumeration are linked to their own detailed explanations,
usually rather technical. </p>

<h2>Explanations</h2>

<h3 id="Hand">Hand positioning</h3>

<p>When we read a paper book we hold it so that the surface of the page is flat
and right in front of our eyes. </p>

<p>That is, a line connecting the text we are reading with our eyes would be
nearly perpendicular to the paper surface. </p>

<p>We position the pages automatically, without thinking of it. </p>

<p>This is so because this arrangement is the one that allows us to read faster
and with less effort. </p>

<p>We scan the text from a bit to the left up to the text a bit to the right of
this ideal position, scanning the <em>text lines</em> that in correctly edited
books are more or less narrow. If you mentally recall the image of the pages of
a novel that you were able to read with pleasure during hours, you will see
text lines containing but a bew words. The amount of text we can scan with a
slight eye movement. </p>

<p>We also scan vertically with the movement of the eyes, up to a point. After
that we move the page, either raising it or turning it slightly to keep the
<em>perpendicularity</em>&nbsp;of the line that connects the text spot with the
eyes. </p>

<p>As an example on the need for <em>perpendicularity</em> recall the text at
the beginning of the Star Wars films, displayed in a severely slanted surface:
that text is rather hard to read because the brain has to do a process of sorts
in order to recognize each letter, maybe building the straight image from the
slanted one. There is no trouble with Star Wars because the films are so
excellent and the text is not long, but if we had to read a whole book this
way, maybe for a college exam, it would take us ages and we would end up very
tired, possibly with a sharp headache. </p>

<p>As a personal experience, I recall having purchased a bookstand in a time
when I was reading some thick and heavy CS books. I thought that not having to
hold the book with my hands was going to be very comfortable, but it turned out
not to be so . Later on I realized that it was because if I positioned the
stand so that the top of the page was in front of my eyes ten the bottom was
slanted and viceversa. Obviously the solution was to set the middle of the
page, but then I needed to stay in that exact position, and it was like reading
on screen, and one of the worst things of reading on a desktop or laptop
computer is the need to stay in a fixed position. </p>

<p>Being able to position the reading surface so that it stays perpendicular to
the line of sight might well be the best feature of the paper over the screen.
With the advent of the bigger screen portables, like iPads and e-book readers,
now there is an increasing number of screens that allow hand positioning, like
a book. </p>

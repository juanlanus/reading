<h2 id="CA-Ideal procedure language">Purpose</h2>

<h3 id="forTheReader">For the reader</h3>

<p>Reading on a screen will never be like reading on paper, but it doesn't have
to be worse. Not at all! </p>

<p>The computer's capabilities can impact the reading experience positively
with useful features not available on printed matter. Like for example a good
text search instead of an alphabetized index. </p>

<p>The general purpose is to leverage the computer capabilities in order to
enhance the on-screen reading experience of extensive documents like books, 
papers and also articles. </p>

<p>Particular attention is paid to features that could reduce the eye strain. </p>

<p>All that, in a context of better ergonomics and usability. </p>

<h3 id="forThePublisher">For the publisher</h3>

<p>The system builds very detailed statistics on reader usage of the copy, 
namely time spent on each chapter, section, subsection. </p>

<p>As a publisher, you will know which parts were read, where the readers gave
up, how much time did they spend on your copy, which are the passages they
highlighted the most. </p>

<p>Of course, it tracks only the users who opted in. These users enjoy 
additional features, like for example a roaming profile that stores their state
accross devices. The "state" of a reader is comprised of
  <ul style="margin-left:4em;">
    <li>current reading points (bookmarks), </li>
    <li>text selections, </li>
    <li>notes and cites, </li>
    <li>and the reading statistics. 
  </ul>
</p>

<p>The table of contents allows the inclusion of links to additional documents
so that an article's TOC can be used as the (personalized) index to a magazine
issue, clustering a set of related articles. </p>

<p>Readers can also purchase server space to store their data independently
of the publisher, as a cluod service. <br>
They will be able to leverage it with HTML documents published by others. </p>

<h2 id="features">Features - functional</h2>

<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>

<h4 id="bookmarks">Bookmarks</h4>

<p>When the reader gets back to a document that she started reading before, it
is reopened scrolled to the last reading point. This happens automatically,
without the reader needing to do any action. </p>

<p>When there is a connection with the server this happens accross devices, the
virtual bookmarks are stored somewhere in the internet. </p>

<h4 id="smartScroll">Smart scroll</h4>

<p>In a paper book there are no partially visible lines. Each page starts and
ends with a fully visible text line. Additionally, some editing effort is made
to avoid splitting paragraphs so that words or short lines are left dangling at
the top or the bottom of a page. </p>

<p>The <em>smart scroll</em> feature provides scroll with the tidyness of a
printed page, setting the start of a paragraph at the top of the viewport, or
at least a full text line when a big paragraph doesn't fit. </p>

<p>This feature's most important benefit is that the scrolling is done by
sliding the text upwards so the reader can keep an eye on it. The jumps of the
regular scroll force the reader to chase a new reading position and to refocus
in a piece of text, probably causing eye strain. </p>

<h3 id="roaming">Roaming</h3>

<p>The data like the last reading location or the text selection or the quotes,
are stored in a server in the internet. 
Thus, one can stop reading a long document at home
before going to bed, continue reading it in the bus the next morning on a
portable device, and still read more in the desktop computer at work.</p>

<p>Each time the document will open in the right place, and all the annotations
will be available in all those places, in different connected devices. </p>

<h4 id="resize">Resize without losing position</h4>

<p>The reader doesn't lose the reading position upon a window horizontal resize
operation. </p>

<h4 id="TOC">TOC (Table of content)</h4>

<p>The document has a very handy TOC (table of content). The reader can make it
slide over the current page with a single click or tap without losing the
reading position. </p>

<p>The TOC works like a menu. It's structure is the document's heading levels,
that can be expanded and contracted. </p>

<p>As the reader progress in her reading the TOC always reflects the current
position. </p>

<p>Clicking a title in the TOC takes the reader immediately to that section.
The TOC remembers the wanderings so it allows the reader to track back to where 
she was reading. </p>

<h4 id="TOCData">Data in the TOC</h4>

<p>In addition to the titles of the parts of the document, the TOC contains
some additional data, like for example the statistics gathered so far. </p>

<p>It can display a bar graph representing the time spent in each section of the
document, the time spent on each section, and the rolling totals. </p>

<p>If you have taken notes, or selected cites, the TOC shows marks
close to the related sections, and allows the reader to check and edit them
at will, always without losing the current reading position.</p>

<h4 id="progress">Progress</h4>

<div class="imgR">
<img alt="progress indicator" src="res/progressDiagram2.png" width="30"
height="100"></div>

<p>The system displays a small progress indicator of the amount of reading
already done and still left, like a book's pages before and after the reader's
place.</p>

<p>An example diagram is shown. The numbers represent the percent already read 
and pending. The thin bar between them is the currently displayed page. 
It has three parts. The grayed part is
the part you are seeing in the current screen, above it depicts the part before
the current screen, and the bottom part is the text below the current screen.
The heights of each part is proportional to the height of the text it 
represents. </p>

<h4 id="timing">Timing</h4>

<p>The system takes note of the time the reader spent on each part of a
document. It also makes a simple extrapolation of the remaining times, based on
the time spent on the parts read previously. </p>

<p>It can tell the reader the reading speed, in words per minute. </p>

<h4 id="bookmarking">Bookmarking</h4>

<p>The reader can set bookmarks to allow her to move quickly from the reading
place to any other place in the document, and back. </p>

<p>The bookmarks are shown in the TOC, under the section heading where they 
belong. </p>

<h4 id="searc">Searching</h4>

<p>Allows the reader to search, not the current web page with all its chrome,
but the content, semantically. </p>

<p>Allows the author to provide an index, possibly with some tuning by hand, to
make the search more semantic than lexical. </p>

<p>If the page is part of a set (a multi-page document, like a book broken in a
chapter per HTML page), the search spans all the pages comprising the set. </p>

<h4 id="L194">Remember other documents</h4>

<p>Stores a memory of the documents or books accessed, allowing the user to get
back to them, and provides a means to edit and comment the bookmarks. </p>

<p>This is sort of a <em>library</em> so it allows the reader to rearrange the
entries, and to classify them within categories. </p>

<h4 id="L203">Quotes</h4>

<p>Lets the user store a piece of text as a selected quote, keeping it somehow
connected to the original document by storing a bookmark to open the document
in the right reading position from where the quote was takem.</p>

<p>(share through fb &amp; twiter) </p>

<h4 id="L287">Links</h4>

<p>Additionally to taking notes and taging the text, it is possible to select a
piece of text and make a link out of it, to a target either inside or outside
the current document. </p>

<h4 id="L291">No repeated pages</h4>

<p>Links that open in new browser pages tend to open the same page again each
time they are clicked. The rt system will, instead, take the reader to the
previously opened instance of the page. </p>

<h4 id="figures">Figures and examples</h4>

<p>It is common to be reading a text that references an example or a figure
that is scrolled out of sight. </p>

<p>One can't be looking at the text and the references figure, both at once.
</p>

<p>This UI provides a means to pull the part of the page that contains the 
figure or example and set it side by side with the associated text. </p>

<p>This is like tearing off the page containing the figure to ba able to see
it together with its explanation. </p>

<h4 id="sidenotes">Handle sidenotes</h4>

<p>Clicking a sidenote opens it in an overlay where it can be read with greater
comfort, clicking on the overlay closes it.</p>

<p>It works the same for footnotes: the text is shown over the current page and
dissapears when you are done reading it. No need to change the reading
position. </p>

<h3 id="social">Social</h3>

<h4 id="publicComment">Public comments</h4>

<p>A reader that wants to comment his reading with others can publish a
<em>public comment</em> that will be routed to other readers reading
the same document who are willing to receive such requests. </p>

<p>This allows a communication channel that can be opened to other readers
expressing their will to share thoughts, forming discussion groups around a
book or article of otherwise unrelated readers. </p>

<h3 id="settingText">Setting documents</h3>

<p>Upon document load do things to the content in order to enhance the
reading experience, like analyzing its structure and building a TOC. </p>

<h4 id="makeTOC">Make TOC</h4>

<p>Build a TOC (Table of Contents) based on the document's headers structure.
Make it available to see without changing the reader's place. </p>

<p>In the TOC, mark the already seen parts and the time used in each one. Also 
the reader's bookmarks and hightlights. </p>

<p>Allow using it to jump to other parts of the test, and to get back to the
current place. </p>

<p>Provide an option to number the chapters, sections and sub-sections, both
in the TOC and in the document body, for the reader to use for references. </p>

<h4 id="displayStyle">Choose display styles</h4>

<p>Allow the reader to control the style of the copy, like: </p>
<ul>
  <li>font size, typography, and color</li>
  <li>background color</li>
  <li>size (width) of the container</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember the reader's choices accross sections. Only automatically apply
the chosen styles to a single document, or a whole web site, according to
the reader's instructions. </p>
<p>Apply style changes on a per-device fashion, it might not be appropriate
to apply styles chosen for a big monitor in a smartphone. </p>

<p>Allow the user to quickly preview the appearance of the new configuration 
prior to committnig it. </p>

<h4 id="multiFile">Multiple files, a single document</h4>

<p>To avoid too long HTML pages, the book can be set in several separate files
each one containing, for example a single chapter. </p>

<p>Anyway, the book is perceived as a single unit. 
The TOC includes all the headers of all the parts.
The bookmarks work no matter n which filethe target is.
Search includes everything. </p>

<h4 id="liveChapters">Live chapters</h4>

<p>In many subjects things change fast. A book written today gets outdated
next year, or month. </p>

<p>This feature implement books as a rather stable stem that references
chapters that are more volatile. </p>

<p>The stem advertises the changes and fetches the updated information. </p>

<p>This way, authors can protect their work from obsolescense. </p>

<h4 id="L425">Variables replacement</h4>

<p>In texts like manuals, there are text particles like the product version
number that change from one edition to the other, and that would require the
author to scan the text in detail in order to update it, should the tool lack
an auto updating feature.</p>

<p>This tool allows to define named variables, insert references within the
text, and the publishing process will update the values when the variable value
changes.</p>

<p>The variables are set in tags like &lt;varText
name="version"&gt;2.4.4&lt;/varText&gt;. </p>

<p>The tool affectively updates the content inside the tag, changing it, but
the tags are kept in place. </p>

<h3 id="statistics">Managing</h3>

<p>The statistics about the amount of time spent in each part of the text can
be consumed by the user, but also are interesting to the owner of the
content. </p>

<p>For example if the content is study material, like a course, it is a measure
of the time spent by the student in front of it. </p>

<p>It can be useful, for example, for detecting parts of the course that take
too much time to read because they are not quit clearly explained.</p>

<p>In a paper or article if the readers tend to give up at a certain point,
the statistics might pinpoint it guiding the author to make a revision. </p>

<h3 id="dictionary">Dictionary</h3>

<p>The reader can select a word or a phrase and search it in a dictionary of her
choice with a simple interaction, get back exactly to where you were reading when
you are done.</p>

<p>The system keeps a record of all the words you have searched for and the
definition you choose, if any. Together with the word and its definition, the
system records also the context where the word appeared, like for example the
document and the paragraph. </p>

<p>This way, if you search again later on for a word you'll get to that
definition quite directly. </p>

<h3 id="notReading">Not reading</h3>

<p>The documents the reader is interested in might not show when it's the best moment 
to read them. The system helps them to take note of what they want to read but
can't do right now.</p>

<p>It will make a list of "wannareads" including a link to the page and
additional information like when did they took note, using which device, and
where were they then.</p>

<p>Il will also allow the reader to add a comment just in case they also wanted
to take note of the reason why that publication called their attention at that
moment like "<e>Joe must see this</e>". </p>

<h2 id="CA-Ideal procedure language">Purpose</h2>

<p>The readers read what the publishers have published. This software helps
the readers to read better and the publishers to publish better. </p>

<h3 id="forTheReader">For the reader</h3>

<p>Reading on a screen will never be like reading on paper, but it doesn't have
to be worse. Not at all! </p>

<p>The computer's capabilities can impact the reading experience positively
with useful features not available on printed matter. Like for example a good
text search instead of an alphabetized index. </p>

<p>The general purpose is to leverage the computer capabilities in order to
enhance the on-screen reading experience of extensive documents like books, 
papers and also articles. </p>

<p>Particular attention is paid to features that could reduce the eye strain. </p>

<p>All that, in a context of better ergonomics and usability. </p>

<h3 id="forThePublisher">For the publisher</h3>

<p>The system builds very detailed statistics on reader usage of the copy, 
namely time spent on each chapter, section, subsection. </p>

<p>As a publisher, you will know which parts were read, where the readers gave
up, how much time did they spend on your copy, which are the passages they
highlighted the most. </p>

<p>Of course, it tracks only the users who opted in. These users enjoy 
additional features, like for example a roaming profile that stores their state
accross devices. The "state" of a reader is comprised of
  <ul style="margin-left:4em;">
    <li>current reading points (bookmarks), </li>
    <li>text selections, </li>
    <li>notes and cites, </li>
    <li>history of read articles, </li>
    <li>and the reading statistics. 
  </ul>
</p>

<p>A table of contents allows the inclusion of personalized links to additional
documents so that a published article's TOC can be used as the (personalized)
index to a magazine issue, clustering a set of related articles. </p>

<p>"Personalized" means that the articles offered are those tagged with the
subjetcs the readers spend most of their time on. </p>

<p>Readers can also purchase server space to store their data independently
of the publisher, as a cloud service. <br>
They will be able to leverage said service with HTML documents published by others. </p>

<h2 id="features">Features - functional</h2>

<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>

<h4 id="bookmarks">Bookmarks</h4>

<p>When the reader gets back to a document that she started reading before, it
is reopened scrolled to her last reading point. This happens automatically,
without the reader needing to do any action. </p>

<p>When there is a connection with the server this happens accross devices, the
virtual bookmarks are stored somewhere in the Internet. </p>

<h4 id="smartScroll">Smart scroll</h4>

<p>In a paper book there are no partially visible lines. Each page starts and
ends with a fully visible text line. Additionally, some editing effort is made
to avoid splitting paragraphs so that words or short lines are left dangling at
the top or the bottom of a page. </p>

<p>The <em>smart scroll</em> feature provides scroll with the tidyness of a
printed page, setting the start of a paragraph at the top of the viewport, or
at least a full text line when a big paragraph doesn't fit. </p>

<p>This feature's most important benefit is that the scrolling is done by
sliding the text upwards so the reader can keep an eye on it. The jumps of the
regular scroll force the reader to chase a new reading position and to refocus
in a piece of text, contributing to eye strain. </p>

<h4 id="roaming">Roaming</h4>

<p>The data like the last reading location or the text selection or the quotes,
are stored in a server in the internet. 
Thus, one can stop reading a long document at home
before going to bed, continue reading it in the bus the next morning on a
portable device, and still read more in the desktop computer at work.</p>

<p>Each time the document will open in the right place, and all the annotations
and highlightings will be available in all the connected devices. </p>

<h4 id="resize">Resize without losing position</h4>

<p>The reader doesn't lose the reading position upon a window horizontal resize
operation. </p>

<h4 id="TOC">TOC (Table of Content)</h4>

<p>The document has a very handy TOC. The reader can make it slide over the
current page with a single click or tap without losing the reading position. 
</p>

<p>The TOC works like a menu. It's structure is made up of the document's
headings levels, and can be expanded and contracted. The last state is saved
accross devices and sessions, of course. </p>

<p>As the reader progresses in her reading the TOC always reflects the current
position. </p>

<p>Clicking a title in the TOC takes the reader immediately to that section.
The TOC remembers the wanderings so it allows the reader to track back to where 
she was reading. </p>

<h4 id="TOCData">Data in the TOC</h4>

<p>In addition to the titles of the parts of the document, the TOC contains
some additional data, like for example some statistics gathered so far. </p>

<p>It can display graphically the time spent on each section together with the section title and the aggregate totals. </p>

<p>If you have taken notes, or selected cites, the TOC shows marks
close to the related sections, and allows the reader to check and edit them
at will, always without losing the current reading position.</p>

<h4 id="progress">Progress</h4>

<div class="imgR">
<img alt="progress indicator" src="res/progressDiagram.png" width="30"
height="100"></div>

<p>The system displays a small progress indicator representing the amount of
reading already done and still left, like a book's pages before and after the
reader's place. </p>

<p>An example diagram is shown. The numbers represent the percent already read 
and pending. The thin white bar between them is proportional to the currently
displayed page. 
</p>

<h4 id="timing">Timing</h4>

<p>The system takes note of the time the reader spends on each part of the
document. It also makes a simple extrapolation for the time needed to complete
the remaining sections, based on the reading speed so far. </p>

<p>It can inform the reader her reading speed, in words per minute. This is
the kind of (rather useless) feature that geeks appreciate. In this system's
user interface design such features don't get in the way of the really useful
stuff. </p>

<h4 id="bookmarking">Bookmarking</h4>

<p>The reader can set bookmarks to allow her to move quickly from the reading
place to any other place in the document, and back. </p>

<p>The bookmarks are shown in the TOC, under the section heading where they 
belong. But the reader doesn't need to recall the exact location of each and 
every item, only by typing in a partial title the content is filtered and 
only the relevant references are shown. 
</p>

<h4 id="search">Searching</h4>

<p>Allows the reader to search, not the current web page with all its chrome,
but only the copy, more semantically. </p>

<p>Allows the author to provide an index, possibly with some tuning by the
editor, to make the search more semantic than lexical. </p>

<p>If the page is part of a set (a multi-page document, like a book broken in a
chapter per HTML page), the search can span all the pages comprising the set, and
only those pages, instead of the standard choice "either this page or the whole
web".
</p>

<p>If the reader has other documents in her shelf (read documents history) she 
can also search them. 
</p>

<h4 id="">The Shelf</h4>

<p>Along time, the system builds a memory of the documents or books accessed,
allowing the user to get back to them, and provides a means to edit and comment
the bookmarks (not the browser's bookmarks). </p>

<p>The user needs to do nothing for this to happen, it's silent and automatic. Later on any unwanted entries can be removed. </p>

<p>This is sort of a personal library that allows the reader to rearrange the
entries, and to classify them within categories. </p>

<h4 id="quotes">Quotes</h4>

<p>Lets the user store a piece of text as a selected quote, keeping it 
connected to the original document by storing a bookmark pointing to the document
at the right reading position from where the quote was taken.</p>

<p>Quotes can be made public through the social networks, allowing the readers 
to detect others with similar intellectual interests and gather (like for example
on Google Groups) to discuss related stuff.
</p> 

<h4 id="links">Links</h4>

<p>Additionally to taking notes and tagging the text, it is possible to select
a piece of text and make a link out of it, to a target either inside or outside
the current document. </p>

<h4 id="norepeat">No repeated pages</h4>

<p>Links that open in new browser pages tend to open the same page again each
time they are clicked. This system system will, instead, takes the reader to
the previously opened single instance of the page. </p>

<h4 id="figures">Figures and examples</h4>

<p>It is common to be reading a text that references an example, a data table,
or a figure that is scrolled out of sight (in other page, if it was printed
matter). </p>

<p>One can't be looking at the text and the referenced figure, both at once,
and needs to scroll back and forth.
</p>

<p>This UI provides a means to pull the part of the page that contains the 
figure or example and set it side by side with the associated text, making
it possible to display noth at once in a wide screen. </p>

<p>This is like tearing off a book or magazine page containing the figure to
be able to see it while reading the explanation. </p>

<h4 id="sidenotes">Handle sidenotes</h4>

<p>Clicking a sidenote opens it in an overlay where it can be read with greater
comfort, clicking on the overlay closes it.</p>

<p>It works the same for footnotes: the text is shown over the current page and
dissapears when you are done reading it. No need to change the reading
position. </p>

<h3 id="social">Social</h3>

<h4 id="publicComment">Public comments</h4>

<p>A reader that wants to comment his reading with others can publish a
<em>public comment</em> that will be routed to other readers reading
the same document who are willing to receive such requests. </p>

<p>This allows a communication channel that can be opened to other readers
expressing their will to share thoughts, forming discussion groups around a
book or article of otherwise unrelated readers. </p>

<p>Ultimately, a critic or an expert could fully highlight and comment a
document and make her work available to the public. </p>

<h3 id="settingText">Rather technical</h3>

<p>Upon document load do things to the content in order to enhance the
reading experience, like analyzing its structure and building a TOC, and
recalling and applying previous sessions highlights. </p>

<h4 id="makeTOC">Make TOC</h4>

<p>Build a TOC (Table of Contents) based on the document's headers structure.
</p>

<p>In the TOC, mark the already seen parts and the time used in each one. Also 
the reader's bookmarks and hightlights, as icons that reveal their content when
selected and act as links to the relevant parts. </p>

<p>Allow using the TOC to jump to other parts of the text, and to get back to 
the current place. </p>

<p>Provide an option to generate numbers for the chapters, sections and
sub-sections, both in the TOC and in the document body, for the reader to use
as references. </p>

<h4 id="displayStyle">Choose display styles</h4>

<p>Allow the reader to control the style of the copy, like:
<ul>
  <li>font size, typography, and color</li>
  <li>background color</li>
  <li>size (width) of the container</li>
</ul>
The layout of the text body container must be <em>fluid</em> to allow width
changes, with a maminum width expressed as a measure proportional to the
font size. 
 </p>

<p>Remember the reader's choices accross sections. Only automatically apply
the chosen styles to a single document, or a whole web site, according to
the reader's instructions. </p>

<p>Apply style changes on a per-device fashion, it might not be appropriate
to apply styles chosen for a big monitor in a smartphone. </p>

<p>Allow the user to quickly preview the appearance of the new configuration 
prior to committing it. </p>

<h4 id="multiFile">Multiple files, a single document</h4>

<p>To avoid too long HTML pages, the book can be set in several separate files
each one containing, for example a single chapter. </p>

<p>Anyway, the book is perceived as a single unit. 
The TOC includes all the headers of all the parts.
The bookmarks work no matter in which file the target is.
Search includes everything. </p>

<h4 id="liveChapters">Live chapters</h4>

<p>In many subjects things change fast. A book written today gets outdated
next year, or next month. A news article can change overnight. </p>

<p>This feature implement books as a rather stable stem that references
chapters that are more volatile. </p>

<p>The stem advertises the changes and fetches the updated information. </p>

<p>This way, authors can protect their work from obsolescense. </p>

<h4 id="edit">Alow text edition</h4>

<p>The document is editable. This allows for copy to be changed and added.
Predefined styles can be applied to selected elements of the page.
New elements can be easily inserted. 
</p>

<p>The document always stays <em>structured</em>, that is, its structure can be
expressed as a multilevel hierarchical TOC. </p>
<p>This way it can be inserted into higher level structures, like a chapter into
a book's index, or an article in a magazine's TOC, or both into the reader's
shelf. </p>

<h4 id="vars">Variables replacement</h4>

<p>In texts like manuals, there are text particles like the product version
number that change from one edition to the other, and that would require the
author to scan the text in detail in order to update it, should the tool lack
an auto updating feature.</p>

<p>This tool allows to define named variables, insert references within the
text, and the publishing process will update the values when the variable value
changes.</p>

<p>The variables are set in tags like &lt;varText
name="version"&gt;2.4.4&lt;/varText&gt;. </p>

<p>The tool affectively updates the content inside the tag, changing it, but
the tags are kept in place. </p>

<h4 id="managing">Managing</h4>

<p>The statistics about the amount of time spent in each part of the text can
be consumed by the user, but also are interesting to the owner of the
content. </p>

<p>For example if the content is study material, like a course, it is a measure
of the time spent by the student in front of it. </p>

<p>It can be useful, for example, for detecting parts of the course that take
too much time to read because they are not quit clearly explained.</p>

<p>In a paper or article if the readers tend to give up at a certain point,
the statistics might pinpoint it guiding the author to make a revision. </p>

<h4 id="dictionary">Dictionary</h4>

<p>The reader can select a word or a phrase and search it in a dictionary of her
choice with a simple interaction, get back exactly to where you were reading when
you are done.</p>

<p>The system keeps a record of all the words you have searched for and the
definition you choose, if any. Together with the word and its definition, the
system records also the context where the word appeared, like for example the
document and the paragraph. </p>

<p>This way, if you search again later on for a word you'll get to that
definition quite directly. </p>

<h4 id="notReading">Not reading</h4>

<p>The documents the reader is interested in might not show when it's the best moment 
to read them. The system helps them to take note of what they want to read but
can't do right now.</p>

<p>It will make a list of <em>wannareads</em> including a link to the page and
additional information like when did she took note, using which device, and
where were they then.</p>

<p>Il will also allow the reader to add a comment just in case they also wanted
to take note of the reason why that publication called their attention at that
moment like "<em>Joe must see this</em>". </p>

<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>

<p>The system has three parts:
  <ul>
    <li>reader, </li>
    <li>publisher, and</li>
    <li>server.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4 id="partReader">The reader's part</h4>

<p>The <em>reader</em> part runs in the browser. It's javascript code that
either is served by the publisher together with the page, or is installed by the
reader as a browser extension. </p>

<p>This part does all the user interface magic, like handling the TOC, supporting
the highlighting, and so on. </p>

<p>It also gathers the reading statistics and other to-be-persisted data, and sends 
all it to the server. </p>

<h4 id="partPublisher">The publisher's part</h4>

<p>The publisher part is about preparing the articles and <em>publishing</em>
them in this system's way. It has its own <em>backoffice</em> user interface.
</p>

<p>The publisher leverages the system capabilities by creating an extended TOC
that includes other article's abstracts and links, to inform the reader about
other material from the same source.  </p>

<p>The edition capabilities of the system allow authors and reviewers to work on
the copy online, writing and polishing it, even if it's already published. </p>

<p>But the central part of the backoffice UI is the <em>reading statistics</em>.
</p>

<p>The publisher can see live statistics of the reader's activity like the number of
different readers, the time they spend on the articles, and said time disclosed
in chapters, sections, or whatever way the article structure is organized. This
includes how much time takes the reading, on average, and an idea of how far the
readers go on each article. It is useful for both the reader and the author. 
</p>

<h4 id="partServer">The server part</h4>

<p>The server stores the reading statistics, quotes and selections, and the 
persisted state (like the current reading place). </p>

<p>The server has a cost that is paid either by the publisher (to get the readers
statistics), or by the reader as a low cost optional subscription when client
side part is a browser add-on. </p>

<p>The system also can be used by a reader without the server part, resigning the
roaming state and persistence features.

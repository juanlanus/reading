      <p>After taking this short course (half to one hour) you will have 
      acquired some informal knowledge about the binary numbering system 
      by recognizing the common ground it has with the familiar decimal 
      numbering system. </p>
      <p>Additionally, you will understand the meaning of a number of terms 
      used to express computer characteristics like "megabyte" and others. </p>

    <h2 id="L366">The decimal number system</h2>

    <p>According to several dictionaries, the decimal number system that we use so
    extensively is&nbsp;...</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>&#x25b8; <strong>noun</strong>: a positional system of numeration that
      uses decimal digits and a base of 10</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Notice that the definition correctly uses the indefinite article "a"
    accounting for the fact that there are <em>other</em> number systems, like for
    example the <em>binary number system</em>. </p>

    <p>We always use the decimal system in real life in such an exclusive fashion
    that we might end up thinking that it is the one and only number system, but in
    fact it's just one in the crowd. </p>

    <div class="imgR" style="margin:0 0 .5em 1em;">
    <img alt="roman numers" src="mooc/AdmiraltyArchLondonCloseup.jpg"></div>

    <p>Like for example there is the Roman number system, that was used until
    recently. "Recently" is the 14th. century, when the Roman numbering system
    began to be replaced by the more convenient Hindu-Arabic numerals; however this
    process was gradual, and the use of Roman numerals in some minor applications
    continues to this day, for example in clock faces.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="onePage">
    <p>Notice that the Roman numbering system does not have a zero. The zero is
    said to be invented by the Indians near year 500 A.D. and is essential to any
    modern number system, including the decimal and the binary systems.</p>

    <div class="imgR" style="margin:0 0 .5em 1em;">
    <img alt="Altamira hands" src="mooc/275823019_568ed233ab_z.jpg"> </div>

    <p>A decimal number system is somehow natural for we humans because
    we have ten fingers in our hands (mostly everybody).</p>

    <p>Some people think that it would be better if we had twelve fingers, because
    this would have led to a 12-based number system, being the advantage that 12 is
    exactly divisible by 2, 3, 4 and 6, and that would have simplified many
    arithmetic problems. But we have ten fingers so we have to settle with a number
    base that's only divisible by 2 and 5. Families should have either two or five
    children, but not three. </p>

    <p>The idea is that there is nothing special or magic in the number 10 in
    addition to it's fit to human anatomy. </p>

    </div>

    <div class="onePage">
    <h3 id="L113">Counting with fingers</h3>

    <div class="imgR">
    <img alt="tally counter" src="mooc/tally-counter.jpg" style="width:200px;">
    </div>

    <p>Lets imagine a method to count with our fingers. There are smarter methods,
    but this one is convenient for the explanation.</p>

    <p>We are purchasing cattle; sheep. The tally counter, like the one in the
    picture, has not been invented yet, so we use our fingers. </p>

    <p>As each animal passes through a narrow aperture of the stone fence we count
    it by extending another finger.</p>

    <p>After counting 10 sheep I run out of fingers but fortunately my brother is
    participating. He counts the number of times I run out of fingers, using his
    fingers the same way I do.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="onePage">
    <p>After counting 99 sheep both me and my brother have all our fingers
    commited, but fortunately the family is large and another sibling comes to the
    rescue counting the number of times my brother ran out of fingers and so we can
    count up to 999 which is enough for now.</p>

    <p>Having the next brother count one more is the "carry" of when we learned to
    sum in school. </p>

    <p>So we bought less than 1000 sheep and it was possible to count them with the
    participation of only three people. Notice that if we had to count more sheep,
    say 9999, we would need one additional brother or the litle tally counter
    pictured above. Each time we add a brother the maximum number increments
    tenfold. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="onePage">
    <h2 id="L3661">The binary number system</h2>

    <div class="imgR">
    <img alt="one-finger hand" src="mooc/Hands-One-finger-icon.png"></div>

    <p>If instead of having ten fingers we had only one, would be able to count
    that many sheep? </p>

    <p>Of course the answer is yes, but with a caveat: we would need more people
    because each of us would run out of fingers sooner than if we had 10.</p>

    <p>Let's start counting. As the first sheep passes I extend my single finger.
    When the second sheep comes I flex my finger and tell my brother B to extend
    his (I'm brother A). Next sheep, the third, I extend my single finger and now
    me and my brother B both are out of fingers so brother C joins. Another sheep
    comes, C extends his finger and me and B flex our's. And so on.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="onePage">
    <p>If a brother with his finger extended was represented with the symbol "1"
    and one with his finger flexed with "0", then the counting sequence would look
    thus:</p>

    <p>As can be seen in the last line, to count 32 or more sheep we need six brothers,
    something that was possible with only two when we used decimal numbers. Each time
    we add a brother the maximum number doubles. </p>

    <p>It can also be noticed that two, the base of the binary system, expressed as a
    binary number is written 10, while the base of the decimal system expressed
    as a decimal number is also 10. This holds true for all bases. </p>

    <div class="onePage">
    <h3 id="L764">Who would want to count in such a contrived way?</h3>

    <p>Digital devices do. Their single finger hand is a type of circuit called
    "flip-flop" that can be in one of two states: either "flipped" or "flopped",
    never an in-between state. </p>

    <p>It is easy and safe to implement a circuit or other device type that works
    that way.</p>

    <div class="imgR">
    <img alt="opened hard disk" src="mooc/320px-Apertura_hard_disk_04.jpg"></div>

    <p>For example in hard disks, that store information digitally in the form of
    extremely tiny magnetized dots on a spinning platter, each dot represents
    a binary digit, a zero or a one, depending on the polarity of the magnetic
    field.</p>

    <p>Another example of binary signals is a communication channels, like for
    example our domestic Internet connections, that transmit streams of electric
    signals representing bits. Millions per second, depending on the price of the

    million bits per second. </p>

    <h3 id="L1729">Binary numbers are horrible</h3>

    <p>As we saw in the sheep counting example, binary numbers (numbers expressed
    in base 2) become very long quickly. Another issue is that they are made only of
    zeros and ones and thus they are monotonous. </p>

    <p>It is almost impossible to remember or communicate binary numbers without
    making errors. For example a not-so-large number like one million expressed in
    binary is 11110100001001000000. How would you read this number over the phone
    to your rather-deaf aunt? </p>

      </div>

      <div class="onePage">
    <p>In decimal notation we use thousand separators to be able to read
    lengthy numbers more safely. For example a long number like 340923476504734876
    is easier to grasp with thousand separators: 340,923,476,504,734,876 and with a
    bit of luck one could read it correctly. </p>

    <p>Now, the same number in binary is this long string:</p>

    <p>10010111011001101000001100001111000101001111110110010011100</p>

    <p>In binary there is a sort of "thousand separators" in groups of four instead
    of three as in decimal. Notice that four is a power of 2: <code>&nbsp;4 = 2<span
    style="font-size: x-small; vertical-align: super;">2</span> = 2 &nbsp; 2&nbsp;</code> and
    the powers of 2 always show up when there is digital stuff around. </p>

    <p>This is not a simple separation in fixed length groups of four bits but a
    "recodification". </p>

    <p>In binary each 4-bit goup can have one of 16 possible values, and each value
    is assigned a symbol according to the table at the right.</p>

    <p>The first 10 values, zero to 9, are conveniently assigned the symbols "0"
    through "9". Once we run out of digits we start with the letters "a" through
    "f".</p>

    <p>Numbers expressed like this are called "hexadecimal numbers" because
    actually they are not any more in base 2 but in base 16. Hence the need for 16
    symbols, the 10 digits and the first 6 letters of the alphabet. </p>

    <p>And again, the base of the base-16 numbering system expressed as a base-16
    number is 10. </p>

    <blockquote>
      &#x25b8; noun: a sequence of 8 bits (enough to represent one character of
      alphanumeric data) </blockquote>

    <p>You might have been told once and again that all digital information is made
    out of <em>bits</em>. </p>

    <p>But given how deadly simple a bit is, seems as if a lot of magic was needed
    between a set of bits and watching an HD film in a notebook; the film obviously
    is made up of bits and only bits, because bits is the only thing any computer
    can handle and store.</p>

    <p>The key is organization, structure. When we were counting sheep with single
    fingers and we added more and more brothers to hold bits, those brothers were
    arranged in a certain order. Not respecting the order would have led to a count
    error and possibly a fight with the cattle sellers with eventual deadly
    consequences.</p>

    <p>A first organization level is lumping the bits in bytes. The capacities of
    the computer's data storage capacities are expressed in bytes. For example as
    of this writing hard disks tend to have capacities like 1,099,511,627,776
    bytes. Obviously we don't say such a number, we say "one terabyte" and write
    "1TB". This numer is another power of 2, namely 2<span
    style="font-size: x-small; vertical-align: super;">40</span>, that is, a one
    followed by 40 zeros in binary notation, 10000000000 in hexadecimal.</p>

    <p>People talk about kilobytes and megabytes. If it seems as if as soon as one
    learns the dimension of one of these numbers, a new one arises.</p>

    <p>Actually it's not that "it seems", it's actually happening. </p>

    <p>These words are measure units, like the Kg (Kilogram) that is used to
    measure the weight of packed sugar. A Kilogram is named so because it's made of
    1,000g (a thousand grams) and "<a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilo-" target="_blank">Kilo</a>" is derived from the Greek
    word &chi;&#x3af;&lambda;&iota;&omicron;&iota; (chilioi), meaning

    <img alt="512M memory modules"
    src="mooc/320px-Memory_module_DDRAM_20-03-2006.jpg"></div>

    <p>The first PCs had memory ("RAM" or "main memory") sizes of about 32
    Kilobytes or 64 Kilobytes (KB). Current computers have 2 gigabytes and more,
    about 100,000 times growth. </p>

    <p>When you purchase a new PC you want it to have as much RAM as possible, but
    over time it will not be enough and you will want to expand it by adding
    current versions of the memory modules shown in the picture (512MB each, year
    2006).</p>

    <p>So memory size was measured in KB (kilobytes), MB (megabytes), and is
    expressed GB (gigabytes) for now.</p>

    <p>Hard disks, used by the computer to store your files, had capacities
    measured in MB , then GB and currently TB.</p>

    <p>Both main memory and disk sizes are expressed as an ever-growing number of
    <em>bytes</em>. </p>

      </div>

      <div class="onePage">
    <h4 id="L1313">Hz</h4>

    <p>One "Hertz" is one cycle per second. It's a <em>frequency</em>&nbsp;unit. For
    example alternate current (the "AC" in "AC-DC") oscilates at 50Hz or 60Hz
    depending on the country. Sounds range from 20Hz bass to 20KHz (20,000Hz) high
    pitch. </p>

    <p>The speed of PCs is measured as the number of "cycles" per second they can
    perform, the number of Hz.</p>

    <p>The first PC micro processors ran at 8,66MHz, current PCs have speeds in the
    order of 2 to 3 GHz, 1,000 times faster. A few years ago the race for speed hit
    phisycal limits, so the microprocessor makers started to lump two or four
    processors in a single unit so the theoretical computing power is the number of
    GHz times the number of processors in the chip.</p>

    <p>To do their work the microprocessors need to fetch data from and store data
    into, the main memory. The memory speed needs to be in tune with the
    processor's speed else there might be a significant impact in overall
    throughput. That's why at some point in time the manufacturers started to
    advertise the memory speed - also measured in MHz, or GHz, in addition to the
    processor speed.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="onePage">
    <h4 id="L1326">bit/sec </h4>

    <p>Internet connection speeds are measured in bits per second. Bits, not
    bytes.</p>

    <p>Old telephone modems, used for dial-up connections to the Internet in the
    nineties, had speeds ranging from 14,4Kb/s (notice the lowercase "b" meaning
    "bit", not "Byte"). </p>

    <p>Current broadband connections are much faster, in the order of 10Mb/s or
    Mbps.</p>

    <p>That's why when you are downloading big files the number of bytes per second
    reported by the web browser is at best about one tenth of your nominal speed.

    <p>The dictionary definition for "byte" given above is somehow wrong (grossly
    outdated) in the part that reads "enough to represent one character". A byte,
    made of 8 bits, can hold exactly 2<span
    style="font-size: x-small; vertical-align: super;">8</span> or 256 different
    values. This is not enough for the asian alphabets made of thousands of
    different characters, neither for the myriad of occidental characters and
    symbols needed, check the "<a
    href="http://copypastecharacter.com/all-characters"
    target="_blank">CopyPasteCharacter</a>" page to see for yourself. </p>

      </div>

      <div class="onePage">
    <p>A byte was enough to represent the limited set of characters that was
    workable until computers turned really international. Now the Unicode Character
    Standard defined more than 95,000 characters with 2 and 4 byte per character
    codes. </p>

    <p>The <a href="http://old.no/charmap/iso-8859-1.html"
    target="_blank">table</a> shows a relationship between byte values and
    displayed or printed characters. This arrangement is one of the many possible
    "encodings". This particular encoding is vastly used in a gazillion web pages,
    millions of people abide by it, is known as "<a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1" target="_blank">ISO 8859/1</a>" or "Latin 1"
    and is an extension of the older ASCII encoding. This is not Unicode, which is
    too complex for the purpose of this course. </p>

      </div>

      <div class="onePage">
    <p>To interpret the table remember that a byte has 8 bits and thus it can be
    expressed as 2 hexadecimal digits. The table contains 256 cells (16 &nbsp; 16) and
    maps from byte values to character symbols, for example the uppercase "W" is in
    the row with "5-" at the left (first hex character) and in the column with "-7"
    at the top (second hex character) - try parking the mouse pointer over the "W"
    in the table. This means that the hexadecimal code for the "W" is 57, or
    0101&nbsp;0111, the binary equivalents of the hex digits 5 and 7.</p>

    <p>So this is how it works at its lowest level: a massive agreement on how to
    interpret a bit structure, in this case a simple set of 8 bits. Millions of
    computers displaying a "W" when there is a byte containing
    <code>01010111</code>. </p>

    <h3 id="L91654">Bytes and colors </h3>

    <p>This section is another example of structure. You have heard of
    specifications for monitor screens that mention "24 bit color" or "16 million
    colors", or the acronym "RGB", or "screen resolution". This section is about
    it. </p>

    <p>In computer graphical output, like a screen or printed matter, the text and
    the images are made out of "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel"
    target="_blank">pixels</a>", tiny dots emitting light of a given color. If
    you'd look at the screen with a magnifying glass you would notice them. The
    pixels tidily aligned in rows and columns of an array. </p>

    <p>As technology progresses the pixels tend to become smaller and smaller. A
    rather recent breakthrough (as of this writing, Jan 2014) are <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina_Display" target="_blank">the "Retina" class
    displays</a> that exhibit the highest pixel densities at 200~300+ pixels per
    inch (ppi), about twice as before. </p>

      </div>

      <div class="onePage">
    <p>With the pixel sizes shrinking, the number of pixels needed to put together
    a screen of a given size has to grow. Doubling the ppi means multiplying the
    number of pixels by 4, right? Because it doubled both the vertical and the
    horizontal sizes.</p>

    <p>For example the first two generations of Apple iPads have screens displaying
    1024&nbsp;768 pixels, and the following 3rd and 4th generations have 2048&nbsp;1536
    resolutions (786,432 vs. 3,145,728 pixels), all of them with 9.7 inch screens.
    </p>

    <p>Similarly, we have also witnessed the grow of the advertised number of
    pixels in digital photo cameras, from a few hundred thousands up to many
    millions. </p>

      </div>

      <div class="onePage">
    <div class="imgR">
    <img alt="RG color wheel" src="mooc/rgb.png"></div>

    <p>Each pixel's color is encoded (most of the times) using 3 bytes, one for
    each of the three primary colors: <strong>R</strong>ed, <strong>G</strong>reen
    and <strong>B</strong>lue, thus the "<strong>RGB</strong>" acronym. The pixel
    behaves as three tiny lights tightly packed together: a red light, a green
    light and a blue one. Each byte controls the amount of light of each color that
    the pixel has to emit to render the desired color. </p>

      </div>

      <div class="onePage">
    <p>Each of the three bytes of a pixel's color is treated as a number between 0
    and 255 (binary 00000000 all the way through 11111111) meaning the amount of
    the associated color to be emitted by the pixel. If the three bytes contain
    zero the pixel will not emit any light of any color and the result will be
    black. On the other side, if all three contain the value 255 the pixel will
    fully emit all three colors and the outcome will be white. The arrangement (0,
    0, 255) means no red, no green and full blue, so the pixel will render primary
    blue. </p>

    <p>From the circles diagram it can be seen that full red, full green and zero
    blue renders pure yellow.</p>

    <p>Using hexadecimal notation the color for that yellow pixel will be
    quantified thus: ff ff 00, the three color components in the specified order.
    Using decimal numbers the yellow color would be written as rgb(255, 255, 0).</p>

    <p>All the possible colors are the combinations of 256 values taken 3 at a
    time, the number of which is 256 x 256 x 256 = 16,777,216 which where the "16
    million colors" meme comes from.</p>

    <p>Check it yourself using the demo below. If the values are all zero the color
    is black, if all 255 then white. When the three values are equal the color is
    grey. Go on and move the values. </p>

    <div class="onePage">
    <h3 id="L2139">Binary numbers</h3>

    <p>We know that there are 32-bit computers and 64-bit computers. Previously
    there were 8-bit computers and 16-bit computers. What does this mean? Let's get
    into it.</p>

    <p>As we have already seen, in a byte we can store a number with a very limited
    set of values: only from zero to 255.</p>

    <p>Lumping two bytes together and managing the two bytes "word" as a single
    value expands the range of possible values to 2<span
    style="font-size: x-small; vertical-align: super;">16</span> = 65536 different
    values. </p>

    <p>For many applications these values are considered non-negative values
    ranging from zero though 65535. Other applications need to operate with
    negative numbers and in this case half of the values are zero or positive, and
    the other half are negative. The first bit of the first byte is designated to
    contain the sign, a "1" for negative numbers and a "0" for the others. Negative
    numbers are stored in a weird format called "<a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement" target="_blank">two's complement</a>".
    </p>

      </div>

      <div class="onePage">
    <p>An application type that uses a lot of unsigned binary integers is "address
    arithmetic. </p>

    <p>Inside the computer the memory ("RAM" for Random Acces Memory) can be
    imagined (simplyfying) as a long array of bytes, each one having an address.
    The first one has address zero, the next has 1, and so on. Nowadays home PCs
    have 2GB bytes and more. That's about 2000 million bytes. </p>

    <p>When a program is operating, it has its data in the computer's memory (BTW,
    the running program is also in the same memory). If the program implemented a
    social-media application, and at a given moment it had a contacts list loaded
    in memory, and each contact was 120 bytes long (enough bytes to store the
    contact's data as the number, name, and something else), and all contact's data
    was stored in consecutive memory "positions" then to access the 12th. contact
    the program would have to calculate its address, thus: </p>

    <p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;address of first contact + 120 &nbsp; (contact number &minus;
    1)</code></p>

    <p>This is address arithmetic and it happens a lot of times. It is done with
    unsigned binary integer numbers because the byte addresses are positive, and
    because binary arithmetic is so fast.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="onePage">
    <p>Normal computers can't directly add or multiply two numbers stored in
    memory. The programs have to use "registers", thus (for the example just
    above): </p>
    <ul>
      <li>load "contact number" in register</li>
      <li>decrement register by one</li>
      <li>multiply register by 120</li>
      <li>add "address of first contact" to register</li>
    </ul>

    <p>and the desired result would be in the register ready to be used. </p>

    <p>Think of the register as something similar to the pocket calculator display,
    that witnesses all the calculations you do. </p>

    <p>Similarly, pocket calculators have numeric displays measured in terms of
    number of digits, and the computers are classified in terms of the size of
    their registers expressed as a number of bits. Thus the 16-bit, 32-bit and
    64-bit PCs.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="onePage">
    <p>Decades ago the computer operational circuits were very expensive. A 32-bit
    CPU's circuits are more complex that a 16-bit's so the 32-bit CPU was much more
    expensive. It's not only the registers that double their sizes, all the
    computer's internal data paths have to be enlarged too to fit the new "word"
    width (a "word" is the data that a CPU can handle in a single swoop or "cycle"
    and is measured by its number of bits). </p>

    <p>Enlarging the computer's word size is a way to make it faster, by enabling
    it to operate on twice as much data in the same time: a computer that has to
    use an 8-byte data item can retrieve it from its memory and store it in a
    register in a single cycle if it's a 64-bit CPU (because 8 bytes span 64 bits),
    but it will need at least two cycles if it was a 32-bit one. Think of the
    internal data paths as 32-lanes highways or 64-lanes super-highways. Both might
    have the same speed limit, but the wider one will be able to handle twice as
    much traffic per hour.</p>

  <p>Currently the highlights are not persisted, as will be in the real application. </p>

  <p><strong>Help: </strong>
  This icon displays this that you are reading now (thanks!). Clicking again hides this text. </p>

  <h3>Purpose and description of the application</h3>

  <h4>You are a reader (or, as an evaluator, you are impersonating one)</h4>

  <p>You, as a user, are a person who reads on screen. Not just a glimpse at the
  news, or a facebook posting: you really read, you are a <em>reader</em>. </p>

  <p>Historically the web has been providing more and more content, but not much
  has been done in order to help <em>readers</em>&nbsp;to overcome many of the
  problems that stem from reading on screen content. Albeit sites are much better
  than years ago, and also screens, published pages haven't changed much. </p>

  <h4>What do the editors do?</h4>

  <p>Those who publish, the <em>editors</em>, are focused on providing you the
  best content thay can. At the same time, they remain oblivious of what can they
  do in order to relief their beloved readers from that eye strain or neck ache.
  </p>

  <p>The purpose of this application is to enhance the online published pages in
  order to make the on-screen reading experience better. </p>

  <p>The method is twofold. It is about helping to control strain, and also
  providing additional useful features not available on paper. </p>

  <p>The editors will be interested in implementing this because it comes with a
  lot of back-end features like detailed tracking of the usage of the texts,
  useful for the authors to realize what parts are read, where the readers quit,
  and more. </p>

  <h4>What does this application do?</h4>

  <p>In order to manage the eye strain produced by on-screen reading, it has a
  new soft scroll functionality that slides the text in a natural way, slowly,
  unlike the normal instant page jums that come with the browsers. This allows
  the reader to be more confident that the text will remain there allowing them
  to <em>blink</em> more frequently (eye strain comes, in part, from not blinking
  enough which produces dry eyes). </p>

  <h4>Some paper features available</h4>

  <p><strong>Highlighting:</strong> On paper the readers can highlight the most
  interesting parts of the text, to be able to review it quickly. This UI has an
  easy to use highlighting feature: the reader highlights the text with the mouse
  (and later by touching it) and clicks the yellow highlight button. </p>

  <p>In the finished app the highlights are persisted in the backend, in this
  prototype one can highlight text fragments but they are not persisted, not even
  locally. </p>

  <p><strong>Notes:</strong>&nbsp;It will be possible to take notes that will be
  persisted in the backend. </p>

  <li>Take note that the test is not on you, but on the system. If you
    experience problems it's not your fault, it's because we aren't done honing
    the system's UI. Hence this test. Your critic feedback is very valuable for
    us, much more than a patronizing "very nice". </li>
  <li>We are thankful with those who help us taking this test. If you left your
    email, and this project takes off, we'll let you know. </li>

    <p>Using the Chrome browser, open the following page:

      >The Loneliness Of The Female Coder</a>

  </li>
  <li>Wait for a while, until the page fully loads. It is hosted in a free
    facility, which is not the fastest, kindly provided by Amazon Web
  Services.</li>

    <div style="float:right; padding-left:2em; ">
    <img alt="the help icon" src="res/iconhelp2.png" width="55" height="55"></div>
    Display the help text by clicking the question mark (?) icon and read the
    <em>Operation of the UI</em> section (where "UI" stands for "User
    Interface").</li>
  <li>Optionally, if you want increased insight, read the other part of the
    help text, intitled "Purpose and description of the application". You are
    welcome.</li>
  <li>When you are done dimiss the help panel by clicking the help button
    again. </li>

    <p>You don't need to remember the instructions in full, during the test
    they will be available by clicling the menu icon. Click once to show the
    instructions, click again to hide them. </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong><em>Smart scroll </em> test:</strong> 
    <p>After having clicked the <em>Continue</em>&nbsp;button, read all or part of
    the article that shows for about 10 minutes, more if you want. It's
    intitled "The Loneliness Of The Female Coder" and is about sexism in
    software development workspaces. </p>
    <p>To progress in the reading use the <em>smart scroll</em>&nbsp;feature, that
    is, advance the text ("scroll") by pressing the space bar and use shift +
    space bar to back up. </p>
    <p><img alt="shift + spacebar" src="res/ShiftAndSpacebar.png"></p>
    <p>The idea is to use the <em>smart scroll</em>&nbsp;feature for enough time 
    to get used to it. </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Progress indicator</strong> 
    <p>Notice the <em>progress indicator</em>&nbsp;in the top left corner of the
    screen and check how it changes as you read. </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>TOC</strong> 
    <p>Using the TOC (table of content) locate a title and select it. </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Highlighting</strong> 
    <p>Select text (by dragging the mouse over it) and highlight
    it with the yellow highlight button. </p>
    <p style="display:none;">Select several pieces of text (holding down the "Ctrl" key) and
    highlight them with a single click of the highlight button. </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Finish</strong> 
    <p>Once you are done, or if you don't want to continue, click the "End"
    button to proceed to the survey about the test results. </p>
